Hi, I like using data science skills to find useful insights in data to support informed decision.

I recorded my case study experience here. 

My research interest is combining Causal AI technology into human decision-making to make the machine learning process more explainable, and to make human decisions faster.

Welcome to share and exchange relevant knowledge and insights.
